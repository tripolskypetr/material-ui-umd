/**
 * Reactions are a special kind of derivations. Several things distinguishes them from normal reactive computations
 *
 * 1) They will always run, whether they are used by other computations or not.
 * This means that they are very suitable for triggering side effects like logging, updating the DOM and making network requests.
 * 2) They are not observable themselves
 * 3) They will always run after any 'normal' derivations
 * 4) They are allowed to change the state and thereby triggering themselves again, as long as they make sure the state propagates to a stable state in a reasonable amount of iterations.
 *
 * The state machine of a Reaction is as follows:
 *
 * 1) after creating, the reaction should be started by calling `runReaction` or by scheduling it (see also `autorun`)
 * 2) the `onInvalidate` handler should somehow result in a call to `this.track(someFunction)`
 * 3) all observables accessed in `someFunction` will be observed by this reaction.
 * 4) as soon as some of the dependencies has changed the Reaction will be rescheduled for another run (after the current mutation or transaction). `isScheduled` will yield true once a dependency is stale and during this period
 * 5) `onInvalidate` will be called, and we are back at step 1.
